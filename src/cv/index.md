  <h1>Education</h1>
  <hr/>
  <p markdown="1">At age 10, my grandfather sat me in front of a GW-BASIC editor with nothing more than a small reference card and my **imagniation**. I took to it like a fish to water, and I've been programming ever since. A great deal of my childhood was spent at the local library pouring over programming books looking for cool new ideas and sample code.</p>

  <p markdown="1">Over time, I began moving on to more advanced languages, the library books were replaced by BBSes, and I knew that computer programming was my future.

  <p markdown="1">The work involved the use of a lot of Perl scripts, and I had access to several Linux machines, so in my spare time, I began hacking together some Perl scripts to help me and my fellow "engineers" with our work.

  <p markdown="1"><i class="fa fa-comment"></i> This position was 90% programming and much more exciting. I helped research and develop new methods and technologies to aid the business in their delivery of marketing emails. Very quickly, our team was able to dramatically increase the efficiency of and the revenue brought in by the mailing department.

The application was a marketplace of sorts that allowed affiliate marketers to gain access to online marketing campaigns uploaded by advertisers.

  <p markdown="1"><i class="fa fa-comment"></i> I was looking for a fun and colorful way to encapsulate my skills as a programmer while using very little screen real estate. I wanted to describe not just my skills, but also my level of proficiency. Paragraphs were far too verbose, and bulleted lists did not convey enough information. I began looking for a more visually entertaining approach. A bar chart would have worked, but I wanted to try something less common.</p>
  <p markdown="1">After doing a bit of brainstorming, I realized that a treemap might be the perfect solution. I wasn't happy with any of the existing implementations that I found, so I wrote this jQuery plugin to achieve the effect that I was after.</p>

  <p markdown="1"><i class="fa fa-comment"></i> As part of her work, my wife was using surveys created at Qualtrics.com to collect data from participants in a psychological study. She also wanted to use Amazon's Mechanical Turk service as a recruitment tool for the surveys. MTurk supports the integration of external resources, but, at least in this instance, the result was less than ideal. The biggest issue was that participants could click a button in the MTurk interface claiming that they had completed the survey when in fact they had not. My wife asked me to look into the issue and see if there was anything that could be done. This project was the result.

  <p markdown="1"><i class="fa fa-comment"></i> Sometimes, I just like goofing off, and this project is one example. A friend had sent me a few links, and prompted me to open them all at once to enjoy "instant class". I was quite pleased with the effect, but having to click **three** links was bit cumbersome. One-click/Single-button sites were becoming something of a meme at the time, so just for fun, I spent a few minutes putting this together.</p>
