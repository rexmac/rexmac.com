## Background

As a "[code gorilla](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programmer)", I have been writing code "<a href="#" rel="tooltip" title="i.e., as a hobby">in the jungle</a>" for over 20 years and "<a href="#" rel="tooltip" title="i.e., professionally">in the zoo</a>" for 7 years. I began as a child with various flavors of [BASIC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC_Programming) and [Logo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_%28programming_language%29), before moving on to Visual Basic and then to more advanced languages such as [C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29)/[C++](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) and [Java](http://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29). I thoroughly enjoy coding and (when necessary) debugging.

I am currently looking for _remote_, full-time or contract work. If you know of an exciting job opportunity in web-development, please <a href="#" class="contactme">contact me</a>.

When I'm not coding (which is rare), I enjoy cooking, gaming, brewing beer, and traveling.

## Skills

I am a polyglot, full-stack programmer. For the last several years, I have been developing efficient, scalable web apps with a focus on UX, a11y, and handsome UIs. The tree(heat)map below serves as a visual aid to my level of proficiency in programming languages and frameworks that I have used recently. I will try to keep this updated as my proficiency level is in a constant state of flux as I move from project to project or try new things.
