      <summary type="html">I decided to have some fun with different background effects using CSS3. Notebook Paper The first effect I wanted to achieve was a background resembling a sheet of notebook paper. I found a “Lined paper” pattern in Lea Verou’s CSS3 Patterns Gallery, but the vertical line wasn’t working 100% when I tested it.

      <summary type="html">I recently setup a private VPN using an Amazon EC2 instance. Unfortunately, while my Samsung Galaxy Nexus, which is running Android JellyBean, has no trouble connecting to the VPN, my wife’s Samsung Galaxy S2, which is running Android ICS, refused to connect. The only error on the phone was “Timeout”. Very helpful. Thankfully, the authentication log on the EC2 instance revealed much more: /var/log/auth.logSep 7 14:38:22 localhost pluto[7325]: &quot;L2TP-PSK-NAT&quot;[32] xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx #30: sending notification PAYLOAD_MALFORMED to&amp;hellip;</summary>

      <summary type="html">My wife and I plan on doing some travelling soon, and, as usual, we will be bringing along plenty of digital toys (e.g., laptop, iPad, smartphone). All of these upcoming trips are for business purposes, so we’ll need to be checking our email and accessing other online resources on-the-go. In the past, I have always avoided using WiFi hotspots in airports and hotels (or anywhere, really) as they are typically unsecured and open to prying&amp;hellip;</summary>

      <summary type="html">Several months ago, when I decided to launch a new blog, I knew that I wanted a platform that would allow me to quickly and easily add new content (and manage existing content), while also spreading my developer wings and having some fun in the process. WordPress I’ve used it in the past for personal projects and also for a few clients, but it always felt…wrong. From a user’s perspective, WP can be a pleasure,&amp;hellip;</summary>

      <summary type="html">Background Recently, my fiancée was investigating the use of Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) as a means of paying people for participating in her latest empirical research. The study involves taking an online survey that she created at Qualtrics.com (her University has an account). The Problem AMT has a built-in feature for creating surveys.
