I took to it like a fish to water, and I’ve been programming ever since. A great deal of my childhood was spent at the local library pouring over programming books looking for cool new ideas and sample code.</p></div><div class="step bio" data-x="2000" data-y="200" data-rotate-z="360"><p>Over time, I began moving on to more advanced languages, the library books were replaced by BBSes, and I knew that computer programming was my future.

I wanted to describe not just my skills, but also my level of proficiency. Paragraphs were far too verbose, and bulleted lists did not convey enough information. I began looking for a more visually entertaining approach. A bar chart would have worked, but I wanted to try something less common.</p><p>After doing a bit of brainstorming, I realized that a treemap might be the perfect solution. I wasn’t happy with any of the existing implementations that I found, so I wrote this jQuery plugin to achieve the effect that I was after.</p></div><div class="step project" data-x="3350" data-y="1400"><span class="title"><i class="fa fa-edit"></i> MTurk-Qualtrics Helper</span><span class="link"><i class="fa fa-link"></i> <a href="http://rexmac.com/mturk/">rexmac.com/mturk</a></span><span class="tools"><i class="fa fa-wrench"></i> jQuery, AWS, Qualtrics, Yahoo!

She also wanted to use Amazon’s Mechanical Turk service as a recruitment tool for the surveys. MTurk supports the integration of external resources, but, at least in this instance, the result was less than ideal. The biggest issue was that participants could click a button in the MTurk interface claiming that they had completed the survey when in fact they had not. My wife asked me to look into the issue and see if there was anything that could be done. This project was the result.

A friend had sent me a few links, and prompted me to open them all at once to enjoy “instant class”. I was quite pleased with the effect, but having to click <strong>three</strong> links was bit cumbersome. One-click/Single-button sites were becoming something of a meme at the time, so just for fun, I spent a few minutes putting this together.</p></div><div class="step project outro" data-x="3300" data-y="950" data-z="0" data-rotate-y="-270" data-rotate-z="-180"><p>For more information on these, and other projects, visit <a href="http://rexmac.com/projects/">http://rexmac.com/projects/</a>.</p></div><div id="contact" class="step" data-x="3300" data-y="650" data-z="0" data-rotate-y="-90" data-rotate-z="-180"><p>Want to get in touch?<br />Feel free to contact me!</p><p><a href="mailto:rex@rexmac.com"><i class="fa fa-envelope"></i></a><a href="http://rexmac.com/"><i class="fa fa-home"></i></a><a href="https://github.com/rexmac"><i class="fa fa-github-alt"></i></a><a href="https://twitter.com/_rexmac"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a></p></div><!-- <div id="overview" class="step" data-x="2000" data-y="500" data-z="500" data-rotate-x="-90" data-scale="7"></div> --></div><div id="credits">    Copyright © 2013 <a href="http://rexmac.com/">Rex McConnell</a>.
