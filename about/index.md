## Background

As a self-described "[code gorilla](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programmer)", I have been writing code as a hobby for over 20 years and professionally for 7 years. I began with [BASIC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC_Programming) and [Logo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_%28programming_language%29) before moving on to more adanced languages such as [C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29)/[C++](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) and [Java](http://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29).

I currently work as a full-time contractor for an Internet marketing firm based in [Mountain View, CA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_View,_California). I am originally from [Dallas, TX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas), but I currently reside in [York, UK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/York). I also spent several years in [Austin, TX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas) and [San Jose, CA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Jose,_California).

I received a [Bachelor of Science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science) degree in [Computer Science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science) from [The University of Texas at Dallas](http://www.utdallas.edu/) in 2005.

I may be somewhat of a masochist when it comes to programming as I thorughouly enjoy debugging broken or buggy code. Obviously, I strive for bug-free code when writing my own programs, but I have always enjoyed hunting down elusive bugs and helping others do the same.

## Skills

#### Web Development

I have vast experience with front-end (browser content) and back-end (server code) web development. I have experience with all of the standard technologies like [HTML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), [CSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets), [JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), [PHP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP), and [SQL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL). These are the technologies that I currently employ in my daily work and also the ones that I most enjoy working with.

Regarding web-development frameworks, I have extensive experience with all of the following:

* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
* [Zend Framework](http://framework.zend.com/)
* [Doctrine](http://www.doctrine-project.org/)
* [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/)
* [CodeIgniter](http://codeigniter.com/)
* [MooTools](http://mootools.net/)

Some of the development tools that I have experience with or use on a daily basis include:

* [Redmine](http://redmine.org/)
* [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/)
* [PHPUnit](http://phpunit.de/)
* [Phing](http://phing.info/)
* [Trac](http://trac.edgewall.org/)

I also have experience with a variety of other programming languages including [Perl](http://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/Perl), [Ruby](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_%28programming_language%29), [Java](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29), and [C++](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B). (Fortunately?) it has been several years since I did any real development with a compiled language, so I'm rather rusty.

#### Mobile Development

I have very limited, hobbyist-level experience developing for [iOS](http://www.apple.com/ios) and [Android](http://www.android.com) platforms, both natively and cross-platform via [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/) and [jQuery Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com/).

#### Operating Systems

I have experience in all versions of [Windows](http://windows.microsoft.com/), [Mac OS X](http://www.apple.com/osx/), and many distributions of [Linux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux). I typically use all three OSes on a daily basis.

If any have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me.
