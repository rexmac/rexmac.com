## Background

As a "[code gorilla](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programmer)", I have been writing code <a href="#" rel="tooltip" title="i.e., as a hobby">in the jungle</a> for over 20 years and <a href="#" rel="tooltip" title="i.e., professionally">in the zoo</a> for 7 years. I began with various flavors of [BASIC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC_Programming) and [Logo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_%28programming_language%29), before moving on to Visual Basic and then to more advanced languages such as [C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29)/[C++](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) and [Java](http://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29). I thoroughly enjoy coding and (when necessary) debugging.

I currently work as a full-time contractor for an Internet marketing firm based in [Mountain View, CA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_View,_California).

When I'm not coding (which is rare), I enjoy cooking, gaming, brewing beer, and travelling.

I'm currently employed full-time, but I'm always interested in discussing new projects or helping others. Please feel free to <a href="#" class="contactme">contact me</a>. 

## Geography

I am originally from [Dallas, TX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas), but I currently reside in [Münster, Germany](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Münster) with my wife, our cat, and _her_ dog. I also spent several years in [Austin, TX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas) and [San Jose, CA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Jose,_California), and I had a brief stint in [York, UK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/York).

## Skills
