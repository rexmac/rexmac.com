# Code for rexmac.com

This is the source code for my personal website [rexmac.com](http://rexmac.com/).

The site is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/), and [H5BP](http://html5boilerplate.com/). Icons courtesy of [FontAwesome](http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/) by Dave Gandy.

I use a lot of Jekyll plugins and filters, which were cobbled together from [Octopress](http://octopress.org/), [BlackBulletIV](https://github.com/BlackBulletIV/blackbulletiv.github.com/), and others.

I am also using a few [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) plugins, [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/), and [Fayer](http://sandeepjain.github.com/fayer/).
